I enjoy writing code that serves a purpose. I started out with Basic things (literally): coding tips and interactive formulas into my TI-83+ to complement what I found lacking in the standard toolkit.
My classmates and teacher alike began to see that these programs were a great way to learn
the basics, study, and simplify some of the internal tools/functions already on the calculator.
Since the AP Statistics class actually allowed (and pretty much required) the use of programmable calculators, interest, and inevitably demand, for my statistical analysis-related programs grew and those programs became the first example of "software"
I "shipped" to my end users (one at a time <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guerrilla-83Linkcable-Link-Cable-Calculators/dp/B008O7K9FW" title="TI-83 link cable" target="_blank">via a single cable</a>).

My earliest professional experience included automating tedious processes through scripts and macros (using VBScript, Selenium, and even Excel), coding Flash mini games, and providing wrappers around unintuitive or insufficient workflows (from tricked out HTML forms connected to SharePoint libraries/services to replace InfoPath forms, to interactive maps of NYC to find transformers and regions susceptible to electric outages).
As my academic career progressed, I took a liking to machine learning, particularly artificial intelligence and natural language processing. The applications of AI, even "simple" AI models, were astounding. For example, you could tackle real-world problems like <a href="https://github.com/mirajp/malicious-news-classification" title="Malicious News Classification (Master's Thesis)" target="_blank">weeding out fake/maliciously-authored "news" articles</a>.

I believe an engineer's real mission is to make life easier for each and every person. I became a software engineer to try to do just that.
