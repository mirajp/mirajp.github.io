            I enjoy writing code that serves a purpose. I started out with Basic things (literally):
            coding tips and interactive formulas into my TI-83+ to complement what I found lacking in
            the standard toolkit (and the TI-84+ that many of my classmates had).
            My classmates and teacher alike began to see that these programs were a great way to learn
            the basics, study, and simplify some of the internal tools/functions already on the
            calculator. Since the AP Statistics class actually allowed (and pretty much required) the
            use of programmable calculators, interest and inevitably demand for my statistical
            analysis-related programs grew and those programs became the first example of "software"
            I "shipped" to end users (one at a time
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guerrilla-83Linkcable-Link-Cable-Calculators/dp/B008O7K9FW" target="_blank">via a single cable</a>).

            My earliest professional experience included automating tedious processes through scripts
            and macros (using VBScript, Selenium, and even Excel), coding Flash mini games, and providing
            wrappers around unintuitive or insufficient workflows (from tricked out HTML forms connected
            to SharePoint services and libraries to replace/complement InfoPath forms, to a RESTful API
            around a clunky trading system). As my academic career progressed, I look a liking to machine
            learning, particularly artificial intelligence and natural language processing. The
            applications of AI, even "simple" AI models, were astounding. For example, you could tackle
            real-world problems like

            I believe a software engineer's real job description is to make life easier for the hypothetical
            user. I became a software engineer to try to do just that and have an impact in whatever way I can.
